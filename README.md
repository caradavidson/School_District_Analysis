# School_District_Analysis

Overview of the school district analysis:

This school district analysis was conducted to analyze different grade levels from different schools among a district. The schools that were conducted were all high school level. The original school district analysis was compromised due to incorrect scoring among ninth graders in Thomas High School. The academic dishonesty needed to be removed so that the data analysis was accurate and based off the correct data.
